# telestrations-bot
A discord telestrations bot

The code is a mess and the system is not in any way scalable, as it regularly saves all its data as a pickle file, but mikel wanted me to put it in a repo. so here he goes ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯.


# Setup instructions:
Put your botkey in a file called `erb-token.txt` in the same directory as `telestrations3.py`. I recommend running this with `nohup`.
This code was developed for Python 3.8.10 on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS, with `discord.py` version 1.0 installed; I cannot guarantee it will work in any other environment without modification.
